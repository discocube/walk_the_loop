# WALK THE LOOP

A simple 'learning by doing' game illustrating the concept of hamiltonian cycles by having the player find a hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits each node exactly once) in 6 graphs (gameboards), each consecutively more difficult than the last, derived from the skeleton of the 5 platonic solids with the sixth discocube graph derived from skeleton of a polycube of an octahedron (like using sugarcubes to create a diamond).

## Description

6 puzzles, each having more edges and nodes (game pieces) in its graph (gameboard) than the previous (from 4 nodes to 32 nodes) results in the proceeding graph being slightly for difficult than the last, which demonstrates the complexity of solving a puzzle with let's say a thousand more nodes.
Once a puzzle is solved, the game will move onto the next puzzle. Clicking on the 6 icons below the gameboard will allow you to skip to that particular puzzle.
The gameboard consists of a graph, which is a collection of nodes and edges. Nodes are the steps and the edges connect those steps.
The goal is to step (click) from node to node (if they are connected by an edge) until all nodes have been clicked and the last node is next to the start.

## GAMEPLAY
Starting:
Click on any node to begin. This is the origin. You will have to end up here to finish the game.

Stepping Forward:
Click on any node adjacent to the current step to take a step.
You can run by clicking on an unvisited node not adjacent to the current step.

Stepping Backward:
Clicking on any visited node will cause that to be the current step, thereby erasing the previous moves.

Switching heads:
Clicking on the other end (the origin), will switch the origin to be the head (current step) and the head as the origin.

Choose another graph (non-sequential):
  The 6 puzzle icons below can be used to pick a particular graph.

Reset game: 
  The key (r) will reset the game
